## pDilemma

### Prisoner's Dilemma
This application is based on a simple game studied in game theory. Background: you are one of two isolated prisoners. Your captives are looking for information from you so you are given two choices, stay silent or betray your fellow prisoner. Your agenda is to receive the least amount of years in jail.

### Choices
* Your incentive to BETRAY is the possibility of being set free, while the other prisoner suffers a longer sentence. However, if the other prisoner betrays as well, you both will be sentenced longer.

* Your incentive to stay SILENT is the possiblity of the least amount of years in prison. However, if the other prisoner betrays you in this case, you will be sentenced longer.

### Payoffs
* If both players stay silent, both get 1 year in jail.
* If both players betray, both get 2 years in jail.
* If one player betrays while the other stays silent, the betraying player is set free while the other gets 3 years in jail.
